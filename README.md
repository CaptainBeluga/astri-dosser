## üìç About
You can use this script for DOS Attack + DDOS Attack (using a botnet or whatever you want)

Dos / DDos using a simple python script by Astri Team. This program will obviously slow down your connection, so it's better to run it on an online shell if possible. ![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg) ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-green)
